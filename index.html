		<h2>The 3D Game of Life</h2>
		<p>In the Game of Life, the population of cube evolves over time.</p>
		<p>In each generation, whether a cube lives or dies depends on how many neighbors it has.</p>
		<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If a cube has between <span class="keep-alive-min">2</span> and <span class="keep-alive-max">3</span> neighbors, it stays alive to the next generation. Otherwise it dies (by over- or underpopulation.)</li>
			<li>If an empty cell has between <span class="make-alive-min">3</span> and <span class="make-alive-max">3</span> neighbors, it becomes alive in the next generation (by reproduction).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Use the sliders below to adjust these initial parameters. Then use the buttons to set an initial state and watch the system evolve!</p>
